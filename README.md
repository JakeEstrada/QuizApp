# QuizApp â€” Command Line Quiz with Leitner System

This is a command-line quiz application built in Python that helps users study any subject using customizable multiple-choice questions. The quiz follows the Leitner System to help reinforce learning: questions you get wrong appear more frequently, while questions you master appear less often or are removed completely.

## Features

- **Leitner System-Based Learning**: Reinforces weak topics through spaced repetition.
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracks your correct/wrong answers and shows your mastery percentage.
- **Flexible Input**: Supports both number keys (1-4) and letters (a-d) for answering.
- **Clear Feedback**: Immediate feedback is shown after each answer.
- **Customizable Question Source**: Add or modify your questions using either a `questions.py` or `questions.json` file.
